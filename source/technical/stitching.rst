External Testbed Stitching

Chameleon provides support for sophisticated networking experiments by providing GENI-style stitching. This capability enables users to deploy networking experiments (layer 2 and layer 3) that extend across Chameleon, potentially other testbeds such as GENI, and into physical resources on their own campus networks. Users can create a dedicated network associated with a dynamic VLAN, subnet with own DHCP server, and router for external connections. 

Currently, it is possible to connect user-configured networks to other domains (e.g. GENI) over circuits created on Internet2â€™s Advanced Layer 2 Service (AL2S). In this setup, a pool of VLANs is extended from Chameleon racks to the AL2S endpoint at StarLight. Currently, 10 VLAN tags (3290-3299) are dedicated to this AL2S endpoint. A user-configured network that is associated with one of the dedicated AL2S VLAN tags (segmentation ID must be the same as AL2S VLAN tag) can be stitched to external domains (e.g. GENI). A circuit on AL2S needs to be created.
