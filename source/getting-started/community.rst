We have created the following videos that you can integrate into your training and educational activities. 

Chameleon Training
________________________________________

These tutorials will teach you the basics of deploying a simple experiment on Chameleon. We will follow the workflow of an experiment measuring the performance of Spark. 
You will learn about how to discover Chameleon resources, how to reserve potentially hundreds of nodes for your experiment, how to configure those nodes, and finally how to monitor your experiment and display the data it generates. These training videos are suitable for beginner users.
