Getting Started
===============

Welcome! We are glad you want to use Chameleon for your Computer Science
experiments. We will get you on your way in these 3 easy steps. 

Step 1: Create a Chameleon account
----------------------------------

To get started using Chameleon you will need to\ **` create a
user account </register>`__.** 

You will be asked to agree to the `Chameleon terms and
conditions </terms/view/chameleon-user-terms/>`__ which, among others,
ask you to acknowledge the use of Chameleon in your publications. 

As part of creating an account you may request PI status, which means
that you will be able to create and lead Chameleon projects (see Step 2
below). 

Step 2: Create or join a project
--------------------------------

To use Chameleon, you will need to be associated with a |Link - project|
that is assigned an |Link - allocation|. This means that you either need
to (1) **`apply for a new
project <https://www.chameleoncloud.org/user/projects/new/>`__ **\ or
(2) **|Link - ask the PI of an existing Chameleon project to add you|.**

A project is headed by a project PI, typically |Link - a faculty member
or researcher scientist at a scientific institution|. If you are a
student we recommend that you ask your professor to work with you on
creating a project. 

A project application typically consists of about one paragraph
description of the intended research and takes one buisness day to
process. 

Step 3: Start using Chameleon!
------------------------------

Congratulations, you are now ready to go!

Chameleon provides two types of resources with links to their respective
users guides below:

**|Link - Bare Metal User Guide| **\ will tell you how to use Chameleon
bare metal resources which provide strong isolation and allow you
maximum control (reboot to new operating system, reboot the kernel,
etc.)

**|Link - OpenStack KVM User Guide| **\ will tell you how to get started
with Chamemeleon's OpenStack KVM cloud which is a multi-tenant
environment providing weak performance isolation. 

If you have any questions or encounter any problems, you can check out
our |Link - User FAQ|, or \ `submit a
ticket <https://www.chameleoncloud.org/user/help/>`__.
