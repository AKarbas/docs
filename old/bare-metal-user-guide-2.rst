Bare Metal User Guide
=====================

In this page you will find documentation guiding you through the
bare-metal deployment features available in Chameleon. Chameleon gives
users administrative access to bare-metal compute resources to run cloud
computing experiments with a high degree of customization and
repeatability. Typically, an experiment will go through several phases,
as illustrated in the figure below:

The bare-metal user guide comes in two editions. The first is how to use
Chameleon resources via the web interface, the recommended choice for
new users to quickly learn how to use our testbed:

**`Get started with Chamelon using the web
interface <https://www.chameleoncloud.org/discover-resources>`__**

The second targets advanced users who are already familiar with
Chameleon and would like to learn how to use Chameleon from the command
line or with scripts.

`Get started with Chameleon using the command
line (advanced) <https://www.chameleoncloud.org/discover-resources-command-lines>`__

You do not need to strictly follow the documentation sequentially.
However, note that some steps assume that previous ones have been
successfully performed.

You can also consult documentation describing how to use advanced
features of Chameleon not covered by the guides above:
