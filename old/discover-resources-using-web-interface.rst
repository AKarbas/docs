Discover resources (using the web interface)
============================================

All physical resources available in Chameleon are described in the
Chameleon resource registry. Users can consult the registry via the
`resource discovery web
interface <https://www.chameleoncloud.org/user/discovery/>`__. The
resource registry is based on the `Reference API from the Grid'5000
project <https://www.grid5000.fr/mediawiki/index.php/API>`__.

The resource discovery web interface allows you to select nodes from the
testbed using preset filters (compute nodes, storage nodes, etc.) or
using advanced filters.

Once you selected your filters, click on the \ **View** button to get a
description of corresponding nodes. In the example below, we select
nodes in the Chameleon cluster located at TACC, containing 2 CPUs with
40 threads each.

This displays the following results:

   <div>

In the node description, we can see that the CPU used is a Xeon “E5-2650
v3”. Using this information, we can search |Link| to get |Link|.
