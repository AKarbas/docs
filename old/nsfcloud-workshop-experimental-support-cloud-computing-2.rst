About
-----

**Workshop:** NSFCloud Workshop on Experimental Support for Cloud
Computing

**Where:** Waterview Conference Center in Arlington, VA

**When:** December 11-12, 2014

`The NSFCloud
solicitation <http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13602/nsf13602.htm>`__ was
established in 2013 as a track within the NSF CRI program with the goal
to provide an experimental platform enabling the academic research
community to drive research on a new generation of innovative
applications of cloud computing and cloud computing architectures. While
this effort seeks to build on prior NSF investments, such as the GENI
and FutureGrid testbeds, it is unique in that it targets specifically
the field of cloud computing and seeks to support and integrate research
in this area with innovate solutions in systems, networking, and
cyber-physical system (CPS) research and thereby define a broad research
agenda for the future.

The `Chameleon <http://www.chameleoncloud.org>`__ and
`CloudLab <https://www.cloudlab.us>`__ projects funded under this
initiative in 2014 are now being built and it is critical to initiate a
dialogue between the research community and the experimental platform
providers, detailing the expectations on one side and capabilities on
the other. This workshop has two objectives: (1) to inform the Computer
Science research community of current plans for experimental facilities
to be developed under the NSFCloud program, and (2) to solicit community
feedback that will shape those plans and the development of those
facilities.

The workshop will be organized by the PIs of the two funded NSFCloud
proposals, Kate Keahey and Rob Ricci, and will be held in the Waterview
Conference Center in Arlington, VA on **December 11-12, 2014**.

 Participation
--------------

Workshop participation will be based on the submission of short (1-2
page) position papers describing the author’s research experiments and
the specific experimental requirements of those experiments. We expect
that the attendees will represent a wide variety of Computer Science
experiments and present a wide range of needs.

Accepted position papers will be made public on the workshop website and
authors of those papers will be invited to attend the workshop in person
and contribute their insights during focus sessions. In addition,
authors of selected papers will be invited to present their ideas in a
lightning talk session. Only authors physically attending the workshop
will be invited to present.

Researchers who are unable to attend the workshop are also encouraged to
submit position papers. The papers submitted without attendance will be
published on the conference website together with other papers. An
option in the submission system will allow you to identify whether you
would like to attend or just submit the paper.

In selecting papers for attendance priority will be given to papers
describing interesting experimental requirements for cloud computing
research coming from the academic community in the USA. Only one author
per paper (the corresponding author as identified in each submission)
will be invited to attend.

Position papers will be due [STRIKEOUT:October 31st, 2014] – now
extended to **November 2nd, 2014**. We expect to issue invitations to
authors by November 7th, 2014.

To submit a position paper, please go
`here <https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/NSFCW2014>`__. You will need
to create an account on the CMT conference management service if you
don’t already have one.

We will not be able to reimburse travel in general, however a limited
amount of travel support is available for participants from minority
serving institutions (MSIs). If you are an MSI participant, please
identify yourself a the time of paper submission.

**Workshop Registration**

Registration fee is waived for keynote speakers, workshop organizers and
NSFCloud participants (as authorized by workshop organizers), as well as
authors of accepted position papers. If you are in one of this groups
you will have received a special registration link from the workshop
organizers.

For all others the registration fee is as follows:

-  $50 for first day
-  $100 for full workshop attendance
