Training Materials
------------------

We have created the following videos that you can integrate into your
training and educational activities. 

Chameleon Training
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These tutorials will teach you the basics of deploying a simple
experiment on Chameleon. We will follow the workflow of an experiment
measuring the performance of Spark. You will learn about how to discover
Chameleon resources, how to reserve potentially hundreds of nodes for
your experiment, how to configure those nodes, and finally how to
monitor your experiment and display the data it generates. These
training videos are suitable for beginner users.
