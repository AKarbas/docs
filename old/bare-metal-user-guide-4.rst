Bare Metal User Guide
=====================

In this page you will find documentation guiding you through the
bare-metal deployment features available in Chameleon. Chameleon gives
access to bare-metal compute resources on which users can have
administrative access to run cloud computing experiments with a high
degree of customization and repeatability. Typically, an experiment will
go through several phases, as illustrated in the figure below:

The bare-metal user guide will cover the following steps:

#. Discover resources available on Chameleon
#. Provision resources
#. Configure resources and interact with them
#. Monitor resources and collect results

It is split in two separate parts. The first targets users who will be
using our web interface. This is recommended for users starting with
Chameleon and will enable them to quickly learn how to use our testbed.

**`Get started with Chamelon using the web
interface <https://www.chameleoncloud.org/discover-resources>`__**

The second targets advanced users who are already familiar with
Chameleon and would like to learn how to use Chameleon from command line
or with scripts.

**`Get started with Chameleon using command
line (advanced) <https://www.chameleoncloud.org/discover-resources-command-lines>`__**

You don't have to strictly follow the documentation sequentially.
However, note that some steps assume that previous ones have been
successfully performed.

You can also consult documentation describing how to use the |Link -
Chameleon Object Store|.
