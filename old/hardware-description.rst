The Chameleon architecture consists of a set of standard cloud units
(SCUs), each of which is a single rack with 42 compute nodes, 4 storage
nodes attached to 128TB of local storage in configurable arrays, and an
OpenFlow compliant network switch. In addition to the homogeneous SCUs,
a variety of heterogeneous hardware types is available to experiment
with alternative technologies. The testbed also includes a shared
infrastructure with a persistent storage system accessible across the
testbed, a top-level network gateway to allow access to public networks,
and a set of management and provisioning servers to support user access,
control, monitoring and configuration of the testbed. Chameleon is
physically distributed between the Texas Advanced Computing Center
(TACC) and the University of Chicago (UC) through 100Gbps Internet2
links, to allow users to examine the effects of a distributed cloud.
