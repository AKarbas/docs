Cloud services have become ubiquitous to all major 21st century economic
activities. However, cloud services and technologies can be
significantly more powerful than they are now. A persistent barrier to
further advancement has been the lack of a large-scale and open cloud
research platforms.

With funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Chameleon
project will provide such a large-scale platform to the open research
community allowing them explore transformative concepts in deeply
programmable cloud services, design, and core technologies. Chameleon
will allow users to explore problems ranging from the creation of
Software as a Service to kernel support for virtualization. This broad
range of supported research includes many other areas such as developing
Platforms as a Service, creating new and optimizing existing
Infrastructure as a Service components, investigating software-defined
networking, and optimizing virtualization technologies.

The Chameleon testbed, will be deployed at the University of Chicago and
the Texas Advanced Computing Center and will consist of 650 multi-core
cloud nodes, 5PB of total disk space, and leverage 100 Gbps connection
between the sites. While a large part of the testbed will consist of
homogenous hardware to support large-scale experiments, a portion of it
will support heterogeneous units allowing experimentation with
high-memory, large-disk, low-power, GPU, and co-processor units. The
project will also leverage existing FutureGrid hardware at the
University of Chicago and the Texas Advanced Computing Center in its
first year to provide a transition period for the existing FutureGrid
community of experimental users.

To support the broad range of experiments described above, the project
will support a graduated configuration system allowing full user
configurability of the software stack, from provisioning of bare metal
and network interconnects to delivery of fully functioning cloud
environments. A special feature of Chameleon is that it provides for an
exceptionally close integration of clouds and networks, which
substantially enhances the capabilities of both. In addition, to
facilitate experiments, Chameleon will support a set of services
designed to meet researchers needs, including support for experimental
management, reproducibility, and repositories of trace and workload data
of production cloud workloads.

The project is led by the Computation Institute at the University of
Chicago and partners from the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the
University of Texas at Austin, the International Center for Advanced
Internet Research at Northwestern University, the Ohio State University,
and University of Texas at San Antonio, comprising a highly qualified
and experienced team. The team includes members from the NSF supported
FutureGrid project and from the GENI community, both forerunners of the
NSFCloud solicitation under which this project is funded. Chameleon will
also form a set of partnerships with commercial and academic clouds,
such as Rackspace, CERN and Open Science Data Cloud (OSDC), and will
partner with other testbeds, notably GENI and INRIA's Grid'5000 testbed.
